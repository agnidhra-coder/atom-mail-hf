## Installation

Follow the instructions below to set up each component of the system:

### Backend Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/agnidhra-coder/atom-mail-hf
    ```
2. **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd atom-mail-hf/backend
    ```
3. **Create a virtual environment and activate it:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
4. **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
5. **Start the backend service:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    The backend will start running on `http://localhost:5000`.

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```
3. **Run the Flutter application:**
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```
    The application will launch on your connected device or emulator.

## Backend

The backend service is developed in Python using **Flask** and is responsible
for:

1. **Email Retrieval**: Fetching emails from the Gmail API.
2. **Email Categorization**: Using **LangChain** to classify emails into
   predefined categories.
3. **Email Summarization**: Generating concise summaries of email content.
4. **Reply Generation**: Creating email replies based on simple English prompts.
5. **API Endpoints**: Providing RESTful APIs for the frontend to interact with
   the backend.

## Frontend

The frontend is built using **Flutter** and provides a responsive and
user-friendly interface for managing emails. Key features include:

-   Viewing and organizing emails.
-   Displaying categorized emails.
-   Showing AI-generated summaries and reply suggestions.
-   A clean and intuitive design for enhanced usability.

## Analysis of Feasibility

-   **Scalability**: The system is designed to handle a growing number of users
    and emails with efficient backend and database optimizations.
-   **Ease of Use**: The Flutter-based frontend ensures a smooth and intuitive
    user experience.
-   **Integration**: Seamless integration with the Gmail API and LangChain for
    advanced email management features.

## Potential Challenges

-   **API Rate Limits**: Managing Gmail API rate limits for large-scale email
    retrieval.
-   **Database Performance**: Ensuring fast query performance as the volume of
    email data grows.
-   **AI Integration**: Maintaining accuracy and efficiency in email
    categorization and summarization.

## Overcoming Strategies

-   **Caching**: Implement caching mechanisms to reduce API calls and improve
    performance.
-   **Database Optimization**: Use indexing and query optimization techniques to
    handle large datasets efficiently.
